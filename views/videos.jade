													p(class="hidden-xs") I truly enjoyed bringing this baby to life.  Her new name is  Sunshine and she is looking for a new mommy. Sunshine has  "Sparse Hair" just like a newborn baby.  Perfectly recreating the tender beauty of an infant just a few weeks old, this baby comes with a new outfit that she will wear home, bottle, pacifier, blanket (if in stock) and birth certificate.  Entirely sculpted from head to toe and handcrafted of Real Touch vinyl, every delightful detail of this darling lifelike doll is sure to melt your heart. Pick her up, and this little one is about  20 inches of lovable charm, with her arms and legs sweetly tucked together, and weighted to feel like an actual newborn in your arms!.
